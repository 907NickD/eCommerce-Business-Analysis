eCommerce Business Analysis

Project Overview

This project analyzes data from an eCommerce business to uncover insights related to conversion rates and customer cohorts.
The goal is to provide actionable recommendations for improving customer acquisition, retention, and sales performance.

Goals

    Conversion Rate Analysis: Examine the data to determine the percentage of visitors who make a purchase.
    Cohort Analysis: Identify patterns in customer behavior over time to improve marketing and retention strategies.

Tools Used

    Google Sheets: Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

Key Findings

    Conversion Trends: The conversion funnel reveals a 29.04% conversion rate from product views to adding 
    an item to the cart, and a 10.34% conversion rate from product views to purchases. This highlights a 
    strong drop-off at each stage, particularly from viewing a product to adding it to the cart.

    Cohort Insights: Retention rates decline steady over time, with initial purchase cohorts showing the
    highest retention in month 1 (e.g. 12-30%), dropping significantly by month 3 and 4 (e.g., 1-5%).
    This suggests a need for improved strategies to retain users in the months following their first purchase.
